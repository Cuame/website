**Academic Misconduct**: Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic dishonesty according to the code of this university.

**Audio and Video Recording**: Surreptitious or covert video-taping of class or unauthorized audio recording of class is prohibited by law and by Board of Regents policy. This class may be videotaped or audio recorded only with the written permission of the instructor. In order to accommodate students with disabilities, some students may be given permission to record class lectures and discussions.

**Pearson Technical Support**: Please feel free to ask me any questions you have about MyMathLab. But understand that they are a separate business entity and completely unrelated to the University. Because of this if I don't know the answer to your question or if I know there is nothing I can do to help I will refer you to the tech support. The best thing to do in these situations is to get on the free online chat: http://247pearsoned.custhelp.com/app/chat/chat_launch
or give the tech support a call (this tends to be the slower option) 800-677-6337
