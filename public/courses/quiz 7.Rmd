# **Question 1**

1 (25pts)
What nominal interest rate is needed for $1200 to grow to $2000 in 8 years if the
compounding is monthly? Round your answer to two decimal places AFTER
you have converted the answer to a percent. Do not round anything at all before
this final point.

 **Solution**
$$A = P(1+\frac{r}{m})^{m*n}$$
$$2000 = 1200*(1+\frac{r}{12})^{12*8}$$
$$ (\frac{2000}{1200})^{\frac{1}{96}} = 1 + \frac{r}{12}$$
$$(\frac{2000}{1200})^{\frac{1}{96}}-1 = \frac{r}{12}$$
$$ 12[(\frac{2000}{1200})^{\frac{1}{96}}-1] = r $$
$$ r = 6.042%$$

# **Question 2**

$$f(x) = e^{x^{3}-2x+8}$$

$$f^{'}(x) = (3x^{2}-2)e^{x^{3}-2x+8}$$

# **Question 3**

$$f^{''}(x) = (3x^{2}-2)^{2}e^{x^{3}-2x+8} + 6xe^{x^{3}-2x+8}$$

# **Question 4**
$$ f(x) = \log(x^{2}+17x-5)$$
$$ f^{'}(x) = \frac{2x+17}{x^{2}+17x-5}$$
